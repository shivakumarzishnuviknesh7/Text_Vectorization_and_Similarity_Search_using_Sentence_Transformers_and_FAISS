This project involves building a system to convert text sequences into vector embeddings and storing them in a vector database using FAISS. Leveraging the sentence-transformers library, the model generates high-quality sentence embeddings for various texts. These embeddings are stored in a FAISS index, enabling efficient similarity searches. The system supports querying with new texts to find semantically similar entries in the database. Applications include text clustering, semantic search, and recommendation systems. This setup provides a robust foundation for managing and retrieving text data based on semantic similarity.
